_Note: "Registered" means all current news sources documented in the Library of Congress's "Chronicling America." "Newspapers" are broadly defined to include **all** publications in print/online that occur daily/monthly/other frequency. Some newspapers (~10) are not included from the scraped data due to ambiguity in location or lack of location (because they might be online-only). Some publications in less-populated areas were lumped with more-populated locations nearby, so the location data of news publications in this map may  not be entirely accurate._ 

The data supporting this visualization is scraped from the Library of Congress's "Chronicling America" [database](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/titles/results/?state=California&county=&city=&year1=1690&year2=2020&terms=&frequency=&language=&ethnicity=&labor=&material_type=&lccn=&rows=9996) and cleaned using Google Sheets.

### Additional tools used:

* [City-to-County Finder](http://statsamerica.org/CityCountyFinder/Default.aspx) (California-specific, used for building the county-level map!)

### Future data analyses:

* Showing the distribution of _daily_ currently registered newspapers by **city/neighborhood** or by **county**
* Showing the language distribution of newspapers by **city/neighborhood** or by **county** 
* Answering the questions "Where are there newspaper dearths in California?" and "Why are there newspaper dearths in certain locations in California?"
* Answering the question "Which entities own the newspapers in California?"
