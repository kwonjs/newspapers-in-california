_Note: "Registered" means all current news sources documented in the Library of Congress's "Chronicling America." "Newspapers" are broadly defined to include all publications in print/online that occur daily/monthly/other frequency. Some publications in less-populated areas were lumped with more-populated locations nearby, so the location data of news publications in this map may  not be entirely accurate._ 

The data supporting this visualization is scraped from the Library of Congress's "Chronicling America" [database](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/titles/results/?state=California&county=&city=&year1=1690&year2=2020&terms=&frequency=&language=&ethnicity=&labor=&material_type=&lccn=&rows=9996) and cleaned using Google Sheets.
